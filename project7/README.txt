HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

You do not have to start a server to run this program. Just simply click the html file. 

This program is supposed to display a silhouette of a street view for a big city. This street 
view has 3 buildings on each side. The user can hold down the left or right arrow keys to control
the time of day for the city. This basically controls the position of the sun. The user can also 
press the up arrow for day and can press the down arrow for night.
