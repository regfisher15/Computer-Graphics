# Computer-Graphics Projects

This repository contains 7 computer graphic projects that were created with WebGL. These projects from my computer science class taught me a lot about JavaScript and inspired me to pursue a career in frontend development.

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1
- Creates a snowflake with the use of recursion.
- The shape of the snowflake depends on the number of times the recursive function is called.

### Project 2
- Allows users to add, move, and delete 6 different blocks throughout the program.
- Users can build something of their choosing using these 3 simple functions within the program.

### Project 3
- Prints the 3D message "Hello" on a screen and allows tilting the screen up/down or left/right using the arrow keys.

### Project 4
- Displays a spotlight on a square stage that can be placed in 5x5 different positions.
- The program should also divide the stage into smaller squares based on the input.
- Features "per-vertex" and "per-fragment" shading options.

### Project 5
- Builds a room with 3 walls and a floor, featuring different textures.
- Allows viewing the room from different angles and interacting with objects in the room.

### Project 6
- Builds a room with 3 walls and a floor, featuring different textures.
- Includes a table with a glass cup containing a red ball.
- Offers different viewing angles to see the objects on the table.

### Project 7
- Displays a silhouette of a city street view with buildings.
- Users can control the time of day for the city using arrow keys.

## Server Instructions

To see projects 5 and 6, you must host them locally on your local machine by starting a server.
To start this server, go to your terminal and cd into the directory where you cloned the repository and enter:

### `python -m http.server 8080`
or
### `python3 -m http.server 8080`

then go to link:
### 'http:localhost:8080'
and click on the html file you would like to view.
