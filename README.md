# Computer-Graphics Projects
This repository has 7 computer graphic projects that were created with webgl. These projects from my computer science class taught me a lot about javascript, and made me want to pursue a career in frontend development. 

# Project Descriptions

## Project 1
This project creates a snowflake with the use of recursion. The shape of the 
snowflake depends on how many times the reursive function is called

## Project 2
This program allows a user to add, move, and delete 6 different blocks throughout the program. Users are 
allowed to build something of their choosing using these 3 simple functions within the program.

## Project 3
This program prints the 3D message "Hello" on a screen and tilt the screen up/down or left/right using the arrow keys.

## Project 4
This program is supposed to display a spotlight on a square stage that can be placed in 5x5 different positions.
The program should also divide the stage into smaller squares based on the input. The shading of the spotlight can
be done either per vertex or per fragment. My "per-vertex" and "per-fragment" buttons do not work but you can change 
to which ever one you want by switching the last two lines of code in the program.

## Project 5
This program builds a room with 3 walls and a floor. The outside of the walls have brick texture
and the inside of the walls have wallpaper texture. There is a table in the middle of the room made
of wood and it has a picture on it. The 3 walls also have pictures on them but the back wall has a bigger 
picture than the others. This picture frame displays multiple pictures one at a time and it can be stopped 
and started again. The user can also decide to view the previous picture or view the next picture. Lasty, the
viewer can decide which view they would like to see the room. They can look from the left, right, or the middle.

## Project 6
This program builds a program that has 3 walls and a floor. The walls are wallpapered and
the floor is carpeted. In the middle of the room is a wooden table with 4 legs. The table 
has a glass cup on it which also has a red ball inside of the cup. The user can choose 
between 3 different views to see the object on the table.

## Project 7
This program is supposed to display a silhouette of a street view for a big city. This street 
view has 3 buildings on each side. The user can hold down the left or right arrow keys to control
the time of day for the city. This basically controls the sun. The user can also press the up arrow
for day and can press the down arrow for night.

## Server Instructions

To see projects 5 and 6, you must host them locally on your local machine by starting a server.
To start this server, go to your terminal and cd into the directory where you cloned the repository and enter:

### `python -m http.server 8080`
or
### `python3 -m http.server 8080`

then go to link:
### 'http:localhost:8080
and click on the html file you would like to view.
